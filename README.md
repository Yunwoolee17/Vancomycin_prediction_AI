# Developing machine learning model for prediction initial dosing of Vancomycin


## Dataset
- Single ceneter (Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital)
- Data collection period : 2020.11 ~ 2023.5
- Target : All patients who has received an injection of vancomycin
- Exclusion criteria
  - under 18 years of age;
  - peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis
  - initial dose < 900
  - eGFR < 50
  - Missing Value

## Pre-processing

## Variable addtion

'CrCl', 'Clvanco', 'Vd', 'Ke', and 'Half-life' are added by calculating as follows.

Vd and Clvanco are calculated based on Bauer Method[1].

Ke and Half-life are calculated based on formulas[2].

 
$$ CrCl = \frac{{(140 - \text{{age}}) \times \text{{Gender(Male = 1, Female = 0.85)}} \times \text{{body weight}}}}{72 \times \text{{Scr}}}$$

$$ Clvanco =  (0.695 \times frac{\text{{CrCl}}}{BodyWeight} + 0.05) \times 0.06$$

$$Vd = 0.7 $$

$$ Ke = \(0.00083Ã—CrCl)+0.0044$$

$$ Half-life = \frac{0.693}{Ke}$$
